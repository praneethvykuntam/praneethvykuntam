# Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

👩‍💻 I didn’t plan to become a data analyst – and that’s exactly what makes my journey compelling.  
🎓 After graduating with a bachelor’s in a completely different field, I stepped into my first analyst role with curiosity and a steep learning curve ahead of me. Very quickly, I realized something important: I wasn’t just learning a new skillset — I had found the work that truly energizes me.  

📊 Data became more than numbers on a screen; it became the lens through which I could understand how businesses operate, connect, and grow. That curiosity led me to **Trent University**, where I earned my **Master’s in Management** — deepening my understanding of the bigger picture, the “why” behind the “what,” and how strategy and data fuel each other.  

🏢 At **Middle House Developments**, I didn’t just analyze data — I explored the power of **AI tools** to make work smarter instead of harder. In an age where AI is evolving at lightning speed, I see these tools not as replacements, but as essential companions — just like any visualization platform or analytical method. The right tool, in the right hands, turns complexity into clarity.  

🚀 Today, I’m ready to work with companies across industries, bringing together business insight, analytical rigor, and a mindset that thrives on exploration. For me, each project is a new puzzle, and the thrill lies in solving it with a blend of **data, creativity, and strategy**.
