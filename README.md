Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

👩‍💻 I didn’t initially plan to work in supply chain and procurement, but my journey naturally led me there. After completing my bachelor’s degree in a different field, I stepped into my first professional role with curiosity and a strong willingness to learn. That experience helped me understand how day-to-day operations support business outcomes.

🎓 Wanting to strengthen my business understanding, I pursued a Master’s in Management at Trent University. This helped me build a clearer view of how planning, coordination, and data support decision-making across functions such as supply chain, procurement, and operations.

📦 At Middle House Developments, I worked closely with stakeholders and partners, supporting planning, coordination, and analysis tasks. I also used analytical and digital tools to organize information, improve visibility, and support smoother workflows. I see these tools as practical aids that help simplify information and support better decisions.

🚀 Today, I’m looking to contribute to teams in supply chain, procurement, or planning roles, where I can apply my analytical skills, attention to detail, and collaborative approach. I value learning, clear communication, and steady improvement, and I aim to support efficient and well-organized operations.
